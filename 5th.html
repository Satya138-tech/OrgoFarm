        <p>It was one day in 2017 while driving to their workplace in Delhi that a couple from Bhopal was left startled. <br><br>

            Sudhanshu Sharma and his wife Susmita Roy were working in the national capital. He was in the strategy and marketing sector, while she was in public health. What astonished them was a high-rising “mountain” that they would often pass on their way to work. But on this fateful day, they realised it wasn’t a mountain, but a massive mound of garbage.<br><br>

            “It was shocking,” Sudhanshu recounts to The Better India. The couple says this ghastly revelation only added to their growing concerns about the city and its pollution standards.<br><br>
            
            “The dust, pollution, and air quality in the national capital would often cause us to wonder how people were okay with it,” says Sudhanshu. <br><br>
            
            Despite the “good life” they were living, there was a looming concern on his mind. Delhi may be an advanced city in the world, but if one cannot breathe clean air, what is the point?<br><br> 
            <div><img src="5th2.png" alt="photo2" id="photo"></div>That very year, the couple made a conscious decision to be a part of the solution. The way forward as they saw it, would be a series of slow and decimal changes, but steps in the right direction nonetheless. <br><br>While they were ideating on what they could do to improve the quality of their lives, they were reminded of a family land that was lying vacant in Bhopal. So they decided to cultivate it with organic farming methods, which would also give them a chance to get in touch with their roots.</p>
