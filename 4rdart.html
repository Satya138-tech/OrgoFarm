      <p>Raised by her widowed mother with five other siblings, Rubi Pareek had a difficult childhood. At the very young age of one, she had lost her father to cancer. Often, the family would not have money to buy vegetables and would be left to depend on dry chapatis (flatbreads) and chutneys. <br><br>

        “We had 150 bigha land but our family had to sell most of our property and all our savings on my father’s treatment. We were told that it was because of pesticide-laden vegetables that the risk of life-threatening diseases like cancer increased,” Rubi tells The Better India.“After my father’s death, we struggled for even a penny. I am from a conservative society where women are not allowed to step out of homes to work. So, my mother raised her five children with whatever savings we were left with,” adds the 39-year-old.<br><br>

        Amid the financial hardships, the Dausa resident could not study after class 10. At the age of 20, she was married into an agricultural family where she found a sense of empowerment. Not only this, she helped her family convert nearly 26 acres of land into a profitable organic farm.<br><br></p>
