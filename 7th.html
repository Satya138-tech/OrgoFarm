        <h1>Woman Helps 1200 Farmers Go Organic, Earns Profits in Lakhs Selling Their Produce</h1>
        <h3>Pratibha Tiwari, a farmer and entrepreneur from Madhya Pradesh, launched Bhumisha Organics to encourage hundreds of farmers to take up organic cultivation and help them sell their produce across the country.</h3>

        <p><span>E</span> ven as the origins of organic farming in India can be traced back to the Indus Valley Civilisation, only 2.78 million hectare (ha) of the country’s farmland – or two percent of the total sown area – was under organic cultivation as of March 2020, according to data shared by the the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. <br><br>

            Sikkim remains the only state in the country to have gone completely organic, but 0.76 million ha of area in Madhya Pradesh’s farms accounts for more than 27 per cent of India’s total organic cultivation area, the largest in the country. <br><br>
            
            The MP government’s certified organic farming scheme covers 16 districts and the model is being practiced in as many as 1,800 of its villages. The credit of encouraging about 1,200 farmers to adopt the sustainable alternative to conventional farming, however, lies with Pratibha Tiwari (41), a woman farmer and entrepreneur based in Bhopal. <br><br>
            
            Since the launch of her brainchild Bhumisha Organics in 2016, she has enabled hundreds of farmers to earn additional income by not only marketing their produce, but also processing it into organic food products, ensuring their reach to 450 customers across the country. <br><br>
            With a masters degree in mathematics, Pratibha said she’d never envisioned a career in agriculture. It was only after she got married that she saw farming practices up close and personal at her in-laws’ home. Gradually, she began practising it herself, while also researching agricultural subjects and familiarising herself with the detrimental effects of chemical farming. When she learnt the extent to which it could endanger lives, she began practising organic farming and advised other farmers to adopt such methods, too.<br><br>

            “I learnt that the biggest problem that farmers face is the pricing in the market. Even if they undertake organic farming, they do not get the appropriate price for their produce. I began Bhumisha Organics primarily to create a platform for farmers to sell their crops at the right price,” she tells The Better India.<br><br>
            
            Farmers associated with Bhumisha Organics receive assistance in all processes, from training in organic farming practices to the marketing of their products, and everything in between. Besides helping increase the income of farmers, Bhumika Organics also aims to popularise organic food products in the regular diet of Indian middle-class families.<br><br>
            “In order to make more profits, commercial merchants sell organic products at exorbitant prices and only a handful of rich people can buy them. But if more farmers take up organic farming and sell their products in the local markets, then everyone can avail them at an affordable price. So, we aspire to reach customers from big cities as well,” she added. <br><br>

Today, the organisation has helped farmers not only from Madhya Pradesh, but also from Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra. While the initiative was set up on a small scale, Bhumisha Organics now records an annual turnover of Rs 35 lakh, she added.
